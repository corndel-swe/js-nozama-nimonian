# Nozama

Welcome to Nozama!

Nozama is a world-class e-commerce platform that allows users to browse and
purchase products from a wide range of categories. Users can also leave reviews
on products they have purchased, and view reviews left by other users.

This repo contains the source code for the Nozama backend, which is built using
Node.js, Express, and Knex. It is an API which allows developers to interact
with the Nozama database, so they can build their own applications on top of it.

Please note that this repo is for learning purposes. It contains plenty of bad
security practices, and should not be used in production.

## Getting started

1. Make sure your machine is set up according to the instructions with

   - [bash](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/bash/)

   - [vscode](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/vscode/)

   - [git](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/git/)

   - [node & npm](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/js/installation.html)

1. Clone the repository (i.e. download it), so you have a copy on your machine.

1. Once cloned, open a terminal in the project folder, and run

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   to install dependencies.

1. Run the command

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   and visit [http://localhost:5000/ping](http://localhost:5000/ping) in your
   browser. You should see `'pong'`.

## Exercises

Take a look in the `exercises` directory for information on the deep dives. As
usual, Day 1 Exercise 1 is labeled `d1e1` and can be tested with
`npm run test:d1e1`. Everything you need (including documentation URLs) should
be in the `exercises` folder.
